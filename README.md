# Usb Driver Error Windows 11
  
If you get the "DAX Driver Error" message after installing SmartSDR on a CLEAN Windows 10 (or later) installation, first check the "Memory Integrity" setting under "Core Isolation". If it is enabled, disable it. The DAX drivers do not need to be reinstalled, a reboot of the machine is sufficient.
 
This was certainly not the first time I installed SmartSDR, it has been running flawlessly for years on multiple laptops and PCs running Windows 7, 10 and 11, both the Home and Pro versions. But it was the first time I encountered this problem. Strange, why does it run without problems on all those other machines and not on this new laptop?

%hs is not suitable for Windows or it contains an error. Try installing the program again using the original installation media or contact your system administrator or software vendor for assistance. Error status 0x
 
Until I ran into the "Core Isolation" - "Memory Integrity" settings. After disabling "Memory Integrity", followed by a machine reboot, miraculously the DAX devices appeared under "Audio Input and Output " in "Device Manager" , and under "Sound, video and game controllers" the DAX drivers no longer showed errors.
 
Conclusion: after disabling "Memory Integrity" the DAX Drivers are correctly loaded into memory. The disadvantage is that "Memory Integrity" cannot be re-enabled afterwards because incompatible drivers are now present.
 
The reason it worked fine on all other machines is probably because the other machines are all a bit older and the "Core Isolation" and "Memory Integrity" settings only appear in later versions/updates of Windows.
 
On one of the laptops, recently migrated from Windows 10 to Windows 11, the "Core Isolation" function is not present, on another it is present but disabled. It turns out that "Memory Integrity" is turned off by default for migrations from Windows 10 to 11.
 
Maybe not a top priority, but it seems to me that Flexradio has a job to do here to eventually make the DAX drivers compatible (but I also realize that the drivers are probably deeply embedded in Windows and that this is not just a piece of cake ).
 
Been there, done that with three different Microsoft Surface Laptop 4 computers running Windows 10 or 11. As you note, this is happening with newer Windows PCs that have the necessary hardware to support the latest Windows 10/11Device Security features.

I too am having this problem with a new-to-me lenovo 540p laptop ( i7 ); re-installing the dax drivers didn't help, and Memory Integrity is turned off...just beginning remote work with s/n 15 6500...dax needs to play for jtdx to work..
 
I just went through this yesterday and with the "Memory integrity" set to off, I just had to reinstall it using Higher privileges (administrator) and it installed fine and ran normally after a reboot.
 
I have a brand new Dell Inspirion 16 laptop with Windows 11 pro. I getting the same DAX error as noted by everyone else. I would like to able to use this machine for remote access for my Flex 6600's (2). I am well invested in the Flex gear - 2 - 6600's, Power genuis, Tuner genuis, 2 - 8x2 antenna genuis, with a new Maestro C on the way. I sure hope to see some answers soon to this!,
 
I have been using the Helix since 2017 and I have always gotten this error message when plugging in the USB from the Helix (thru all of the Helix updates). Is this the same fix for Windows 7? (yes I have put in a ticket on this problem with no resolution)
 
Does turning core isolation off make the computer vulnerable to viruses? I had the same problem with my X3 Live not being recognised by my PC, turning the core isolation off worked as recommended above. My question is, should I turn the isolation back on now? Or will that stop the drivers from working?
 
Also, I noticed on the Line6 software downloads page, that Windows 11 (what I'm running) isn't listed in the drop-down menu. I went for Windows 10, maybe that has something to do with the drivers not working?
 
thanks for your quick reply IIIaass. I have downloaded all the windows support drivers from bootcamp assistant but nothing seems to be working, reinstalled, repaired the drivers etc. it says 'driver error' could you send a link to correct driver for wireless keyboard. Maybe, it is the driver!
 
I installed bootcamp the both to a mac mini, and everything works fine there (wireless keyboard too), but for the installation onto a macpro late 2013 everything works fine, WI-FI, GPU, wireless mouse, BT, etc. all of the drivers are OK, with the exception of the wireless keyboard where the bluetooth manager says: Driver Error.
 
You have to go to "Device Manager" (right click on Start: Device Manager option), at the HID leaf (that stands open 'cause of a driver error), simply uninstall and delete the wrong driver. Magically everything works fine, and the wireless keyboard will be reported on the Keyboards leaf of the Device Manager.
 
This didn't work for me. I have exactly the same problem. It says "driver error" for the keyboard, while the magic mouse works fine. If I delete the driver, it shows a "System Administrator's Keyboard" is connected with bluetooth, but the keyboard still doesn't work.
 
Recently purchased and set up a Pro-1000. I was able to connect to the Wi-Fi network through the printer itself, and Windows can find my printer. I can also find the printer when I go through the setup wizard.
 
This appears to work, for now. I'm in a bit of a conundrum because now I have this Canon printer but now hate Canon with a fiery passion. I believe there may be some issues with their driver signatures that cause installation errors on some Windows configurations.
 
You have to install the software before hooking the printer up to the computer.....had the same problem with another canon printer. Delete any instances in the settings area. Then install the drivers, etc. the software will tell you when to turn on the printer. Make sure the printer is not on while you are installing the software, otherwise windows will find it and install it's own version.
 
Thanks but I'm not sure if that's possible. The installer requries the printer to be on and connected, because one of the early steps in the installer is to select your printer from the list of available/connected printers.
 
I was able to reach Canon by phone today. They said this is a known issue and they do not have a fix for it. They blamed it on Windows, but I have had no issues installing any other software or drivers on this machine. They said it's a Windows issue that can crop up with any Canon printer driver.
 
It's possible, although checking Canon's driver signature with DigiCert shows that one of the signatures expired in Feb 2020. It additionally throws a warning that the signature doesn't contain a timestamp.
 
Upon plugging the UB400 adapter into my Windows 10 PC, it shows a "driver error" in bluetooth devices. And in device manager, it shows as "Generic Bluetooth Radio". There is no adapter recognized in device manager. I've tried searching for and updating the driver software, but it says it's the latest. My expectation is that this is plug and play and should not require the 400mb software download from TP-Link.
 
After the last update for Windows 11 insider (Home). The driver for the wireless card stopped working. There is already a guide on the issue on Intel's boards, but it is not working either. So i think the issue is with the Windows.
 
I managed to bring my Killer wireless network adapter back - after wasted a whole morning. Windows updated overnight and I lost the card after that. This was the error I saw in Event Viewer:


 
@OussD After a lot of research, the problem is usually solved by resetting the bios to default, mainly on dell laptops. The problem is caused after doing bios update or installing windows 11.
Also don't forget to install the updated drivers.
 
@ballon999 This is not working on my Surface Pro 7. I've tried uninstalling and removing the driver completely several times and each time on the restart it automatically comes back (even when I'm not connected to the internet). I had Windows 11 and reverted back to Windows 10 and still not right.
 
I had a similar issue when I got my first wifi 6 networking card. My solution was to turn off automatic band selection in the wifi router settings. Apparently the network card couldn't handle when the band changed (something that the router did seemingly randomly), and so the network card errored out and stopped working until it was reset. However, after I turned off automatic band selection there hasn't been another issue, with that machine.
 
Everyone, try removing the driver then shutting down the OS, not reset/reboot. I've been fighting this for 2 days straight and even after a complete OS reinstall/downgrade from 11 to 10 the problem is still there. Immediately after the reinstall the wifi adapter worked, but after a few reboots it went back to the same issues/events in the system log. Then I tried removing the driver and shutting down completely before powering back on and the wifi is now working. For how long who knows, but give this a shot if you are struggling.
 
Did you ever get this fixed? I am having the same issue right now with my Void USB RGB, I was updating the firmware on the headset and now it detects the USB Composite Device, but it fails to start, error code 10.
 
I have Windows 7 64 bit, i have confirmed all my drivers are good with updates and SFC for the windows native drivers, and I even did a system restore to last week, when it worked fine, but same thing. The crazy thing is that I can plug it into my wife's PC and it works fine. I have tried updating the firmware when plugged into hers and it updates successfully, on 0.17 now. I have uninstalled and reinstalled CUE completely, even nuking the corsair registry entries and the local and roaming appdata.
